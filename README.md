# Using Wrapper Class For Request State

RequestState() is a fundamental wrapper class designed for daily usage, particularly in software development projects involving network requests or API integrations. This versatile class encapsulates the state and metadata associated with a request, offering developers a convenient and efficient means to manage and track request-related information.

At its core, RequestState() simplifies the handling of request data by providing a structured container for essential components such as request parameters, headers, response data, and status codes. By encapsulating these elements within a single entity, developers can streamline their code, enhance readability, and maintain consistency across their projects.

Moreover, RequestState() offers functionalities to handle various aspects of request management, including error handling, retries, caching, and logging. This encapsulation of request-related operations within a dedicated class promotes code reusability and modularity, facilitating the development of robust and maintainable software systems.
